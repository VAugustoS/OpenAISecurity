Made by AI: A Modern Monty Python Skit Sketch

I was recently working on a demo using my own Azure OpenAI Copilot and I asked it to write “a modern Monty Python skit script.” The following is what my own Copilot produced and thought it too good to not share. Maybe at a conference in the near future, I can get some attendees to help act this out for YouTube.

Title: "The Influencer Café"
[Scene: A trendy café, with minimalist décor, succulents on the tables, and a neon sign saying "But first, coffee" on the wall. A group of Monty Python members are seated together, all wearing hipster clothing, such as oversized glasses, beanies, and skinny jeans. They are all holding smartphones and sipping on various trendy beverages.]

Eric: (looking up from his phone) Ugh, I can't seem to gain any new followers on InstaSnapBook! I've been posting avocado toast pictures for days!

Terry: Did you try adding a vintage filter and hashtagging #blessed?

Michael: Or maybe you should switch to posting pictures of yourself doing yoga in exotic locations!

Graham: (snootily) I only post pictures of my designer coffee foam art. I gained 3,000 followers last week alone.

John: (excitedly) Oh! I've got it! Why not take a selfie with a celebrity? That's sure to get you more attention!

Eric: But where are we going to find a celebrity around here?

[Suddenly, a wild-eyed man in a disheveled suit enters the café, holding a rubber chicken. It's George, played by Terry Gilliam.]

George: (shouting) Excuse me, everyone! I have an important announcement! I've just discovered the true meaning of life!

[Everyone in the café looks up from their phones, annoyed by the interruption.]

Michael: (sarcastically) Oh great, another conspiracy theorist.

Graham: Can't you see we're busy cultivating our personal brands?

George: (frantically) No, you don't understand! I've spent years researching and traveling the world, and I've finally found the answer!

Eric: (unimpressed) And what is the true meaning of life, then?

George: (holds up the rubber chicken) It's this! This rubber chicken holds the key to happiness and enlightenment!

[The group exchanges skeptical glances.]

Terry: (mockingly) So the meaning of life is... a rubber chicken?

George: (nodding) Yes! It's a symbol of humor and absurdity in a chaotic world. If we can learn to embrace the ridiculousness of life and not take ourselves so seriously, we'll find true happiness.

[The group ponders this for a moment.]

Michael: (smirking) So you're saying that if we take a selfie with this rubber chicken, we'll gain enlightenment and thousands of followers?

George: (exasperated) Well, no, that's not exactly what I meant...

John: (interrupting) Let's do it! Everyone gather around for a group selfie with the chicken!

[The group eagerly huddles together, holding up their phones, and George reluctantly holds the rubber chicken in the center. They take the selfie and immediately begin posting it on their social media accounts.]

Eric: (gleefully) Look! I've already gained 100 new followers!

Terry: (adding filters) This is definitely going on my story.

Graham: (smugly) I told you, I only post coffee foam art.

[George, looking defeated, realizes his message is lost on the group. He sighs and exits the café, rubber chicken in hand.]

John: (still looking at his phone) Well, that was a strange interruption. So, what do you think of my new espresso machine?

[The group returns to their original conversation, as the camera pans out and the screen fades to black.]

//Retrieves information about a Chatbot conversation (web app), including client IP, bytes passed between client and chatobt, and how long the response took.
//This is a start. The IP and max response bytes can be used to identify potential anomalous behavior. For example, the same IP over a brief period of time
//resulting in more than expected response bytes.

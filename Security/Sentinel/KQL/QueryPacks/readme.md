# Query Packs

Query packs are an Azure Resource Manager object that act as a container to store queries. This provides a way to save KQL queries and share them across multiple workspaces, or to the community.

Guidance can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/query-packs)

You can deploy the queries from this repo to your Azure environment by deploying the following template.
